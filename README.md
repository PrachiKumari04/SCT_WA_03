## Tic Tac Toe Game in Python

This repository contains a Python implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game with two modes:

* **Versus Computer:** Play against a simple AI opponent.
* **2 Player:** Play against a friend or family member.

**Features:**

* User-friendly game interface (text-based).
* Clear instructions for each player.
* Tracks the game state and displays the board.
* Determines the winner or a tie outcome.

**Getting Started:**

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory.
3. Install any required dependencies (if applicable).
4. Run the game using `python tic_tac_toe.py`.

**Code Structure:**

* `tic_tac_toe.py`: Contains the main game logic, including functions for:
    * Displaying the game board
    * Getting user input
    * Checking for win/tie conditions
    * Handling computer moves (if applicable)

**Playing the Game:**

1. Choose your mode: versus computer (type '1') or 2 player (type '2').
2. Follow the on-screen instructions to take turns placing your marks (X or O).
3. The game will announce the winner or a tie when the match concludes.

**Additional Notes:**

* Consider adding error handling for invalid user input.
* You can improve the AI by implementing minimax or alpha-beta pruning algorithms for a more challenging opponent (optional).
* Feel free to customize the game board representation, user interface messages, and difficulty levels.
